# Finding the Power  
A Data Science Project on Global Energy, Emissions, and Predictive Modeling

## Project Overview
Finding the Power explores relationships between global energy consumption, electricity production, and carbon emissions. Using multiple public datasets, preprocessing workflows, and both regression and classification modeling techniques, this project aims to uncover patterns and predictive insights about worldwide energy and emissions trends.

## Datasets Used
- **World Emissions Dataset** – World Bank Indicators  
- **World Energy Consumption** – Kaggle (World Energy Consumption dataset)  
- **Additional references** used for images and context (maps, analytics visuals, etc.)

## Project Goals
- Acquire and clean global energy and emissions datasets  
- Preprocess large-scale, multi-year international data  
- Build machine-learning models to explore predictive relationships  
- Visualize insights through Tableau dashboards and model output graphics  

## Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing or inconsistent indicators  
- Normalizing and merging datasets across different sources  
- Converting World Bank data using official metadata guidelines  
  (https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519)  
- Feature engineering for energy production and emissions modeling  

## Modeling

### Regression Models
Used to predict various continuous energy-related outcomes.  
Key performance metrics included:
- Model 1: 86.4% accuracy  
- Model 2: 92.3% accuracy  

### Classification Models
Classification techniques were used to categorize countries or time-periods based on electricity-related patterns or emissions levels.

#### Electricity Production Decision Tree
A decision-tree classifier was built to segment patterns in global electricity output.  
Visualization included in the presentation.

## Tableau Dashboard
An interactive Tableau visualization was created to explore processed datasets.

## Insights & Takeaways
- Strong predictive power exists between certain consumption and emissions indicators.  
- Regression performance suggests global energy trends are highly structured and modelable.  
- Classifiers such as decision trees provide interpretable pathways for understanding electricity production patterns.
